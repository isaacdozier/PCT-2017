	<p>
		Thanks for checking out my 2017 PCT Journal from the Cascade Locks, OR to Stevens Pass, WA sections.
		It was an especiialy devistating year on the trail, as many large wildfires left looming clouds of smoke hovering over 
		the area for quite some time. I eventually lef the trail early at Stevens pass and will atempt to finish next year.
		
		I also was forced off trail due to a strained ligament in my leg. It's all in the journal.
		 
		Enjoy!
